# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I have a pretty good grasp of HTML5 and CSS, I hope this translates well with JavaScript.

**Link(s) to work:** Null


### Day 2: May 23, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and got started on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I was having difficulty putting a navigation bar at the top of my window that stays on top of the content. I'm wondering if Bootstrap is acting up, or my programming skills aren't up to par. I went through many websites and forums for help, still no luck with the responsive formatting, I'm hoping tomorrow will yield better results.

### Day 3: May 24, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and make some progress on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** Today was a much better day for coding. Just trying the same problem again on a different day can make such a difference. I also was more aware of making sure my portfolio has my own style embedded into it. Too many times I copy something without adding my own flavour to it. I'm hoping that will come more natually once I have a better grasp of programming in general.

The rest of my days will be added tomorrow. Just need to transfer them from my written notes/browser history.
