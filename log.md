# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I have a pretty good grasp of HTML5 and CSS, I hope this translates well with JavaScript.

### Day 2: May 23, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and got started on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I was having difficulty putting a navigation bar at the top of my window that stays on top of the content. I'm wondering if Bootstrap is acting up, or my programming skills aren't up to par. I went through many websites and forums for help, still no luck with the responsive formatting, I'm hoping tomorrow will yield better results.

### Day 3: May 24, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and make some progress on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** Today was a much better day for coding. Just trying the same problem again on a different day can make such a difference. I also was more aware of making sure my portfolio has my own style embedded into it. Too many times I copy something without adding my own flavour to it. I'm hoping that will come more natually once I have a better grasp of programming in general.

### Day 4: May 25, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and did some research on Vue.js frameworks.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't do as much hard-coding as I would haved liked, the bulk of my time today was researching and learning the Vue.js framework. I met with a mentor and friend today, who I shared my summer goals of learning to code with, he was very supportive and we talked code. Sharing my aspirations with others really gives it a sense of meaning and validates that I'm doing the right thing.

### Day 5: May 26, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 22 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, these were on basic JavaScript. I also started working on a personal coding project, a talent quick guide for when I play Heroes of the Storm.

**Thoughts:** I know, my personal project is pretty nerdy, but I read some FreeCodeCamp medium articles, and they all seem to suggest building personal projects. These give you the best experience, as you think of a problem and try to solve it with code. My 'problem' was that I tend to google the best character builds just before a match. Since I use the same site everytime, why not code a mobile-responsive website with all the information I need at my fingertips. I knew I had the basic skills to code it, as there is no backend or scripting required, it seems like a perfect first project.

### Day 6: May 27, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 52 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was on fire today! The JavaScript exercises just clicked and I as able to breeze through the majority of them. I was struggling a little bit with the arrays, as I always have with using Processing at school. I have a feeling that the basic scripting exercises will be array based, I'm hoping my learning today can be retained for later use.

### Day 7: May 28, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These set of exercises were the intro to object oriented programming, another aspect of Processing I struggled with. The exercises were very basic, and I hoping there are more to learn at FreeCodeCamp. Otherwise, I will have to work on them on my own some more.

### Day 8: May 29, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 9 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These exercises also revolved around arrays, the bane of my existence. Once I am confident manipulating and leveraging the power of arrays, in some way, I will feel that I have made tremendous progress on my journey of learning to code. These examples are simple to do, but once I look up other examples online, I need to spend much more time dissecting and learning how they function.

### Day 9: May 30, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** So it begins. The deaded chapter of basic algorithm scripting. I've been coding with Processing for about 3 years (on and off), and algorithm scripting is something I've always struggled with. No matter, I will take them one at a time. There seems to be a trend where I can figure out how the function should be laid out, it's just the proper formatting and order of things I need more practice on.

### Day 10: May 31, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to give myself a little confidence boost by working on the jQuery chapter on FreeCodeCamp. This module was only 2 hours to complete, and learning the new syntax was exciting. Working on the JavaScript was advanced for me, learning something at the early stages always boosts my confidence.

### Day 11: June 01, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and began my developmentnotes GitHub repo.

**Thoughts:** I went back to the JavaScript algorithms and had the same experience as before. Slow as steady, thinking I'm making steady progress, when I fall short 90% of the way in. I did some research online, and it seems that, as long as I take the time and care to really understand where I'm falling short, there's no reason why I can't look for help. After all, the Read-Search-Ask methodology is heavily advertised all over the coding community. My development notes repo is where I will be storing all the coding techniques I've come across and used. My reasoning to start this was after my struggles on the algorithms, I had no organized way to look back on what I've learned, and I certainly can't remember everything off the top of my head. These notes will also develop my familiarity with GitHub, another skill I need to learn!

### Day 12: June 02, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and completed a 4 video tutorial on Vue.js

**Thoughts:** After spending a considerable amount of time on merely 3 algorihtm exercises, I wanted a change of pace without jumping too far on FreeCodeCamp. My mentor sent me a YouTube playlist of an intro to Vue.js (only about an hour in total). I went through these videos with ease, as the Vue.js framework was designed to have jQuery capabilities with much less coding syntax needed.

### Day 13: June 03, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentnotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today felt like one of those "just going through the motions" days. Although I did spend a lot of time on a low amount of exercises. The majority of my time was searching through forums and learning the several new coding techniques that I need, but wasn't exposed to, in order to complete the algorithm exercises. Yet another validation of my developmentnotes wiki. It's taking a while to go through all the code I've already learned and place it in the wiki, cannot wait to be up to date on that!

### Day 14: June 04, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentnotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Now, today felt like a repeat of yesterday with a twist, I had a positive attitude. Yesterday, I felt discouraged for basically needing the coding community to hold my hand every step of the way for the exercises I wanted to complete. Today, I felt that the coding community had my back and encouraged my to push through the tough times. I hope for one day that I can be the one who answers the questions on the forums, some day. I also won't provide link updates on my wiki everytime I made a contribution, that might become a little redundant. Only when I either make a major change or addition, will I address it in this log.

### Day 15: June 05, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Forked my first repo (100DaysOfCode), and made some major updates to my developmentnotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Maybe it's just me, but I've always loved Mondays. A fresh start to the working week, time to set goals, get organized, and start working. Today, I took a little break from FreeCodeCamp and focused on my action plans for taking my coding to the next level. I came across the 100DaysOfCode challenge and instantly wanted to be a part of it. Looking back at my coding history, I'm actually on day 15 of coding at least 1 hour every day! Today is no different, but I officially made my pledge to commit to the challenge. After some discouragement from the FreeCodeCamp algorithms, I felt the need to complete at least 1 exercise a day to get that calendar contribution box to go green. I've finally realized how silly that was. Why basically skip an exercise just to prove that I 'coded' that day? The 100DaysOfCode is perfect! Forking the repo, and keeping a log keeps me accountable for how I spend my coding time. Here's to 85 more days of learning to code!

### Day 16: June 06, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress updating my development notes wiki (completed Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, and the majority of Basic JavaScript], and completed 50 exercises on the Mimo app.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to ensure that what I learned so far on FreeCodeCamp was being retained in my head. My biggest contributions today was going over the JavaScript module for my wiki. Just the process of re-reading the exercies and jotting down the notes somewhere really helps. Whenever I came across an exercise that didn't blatantly give away the answer, I would redo it to see if I retained the information. I also tried out the Premium version of the Mimo app, a mobile app that teaches you to code (think Duolingo for coding). It's pretty fun, and has it's own style to teaching, but I think I'll keep my programming to the computer for now.
