# 100 Days Of Code - Log

***

### Day 1: May 22, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I have a pretty good grasp of HTML5 and CSS, I hope this translates well with JavaScript. I have been working on exercises on FreeCodeCamp for about 2 weeks now, today is the day I begin to code everyday with (fingers crossed) missing a day! I'm very excited to work on this challenge!

### Day 2: May 23, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and got started on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I was having difficulty putting a navigation bar at the top of my window that stays on top of the content. I'm wondering if Bootstrap is acting up, or my programming skills aren't up to par. I went through many websites and forums for help, still no luck with the responsive formatting, I'm hoping tomorrow will yield better results.

### Day 3: May 24, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and make some progress on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** Today was a much better day for coding. Just trying the same problem again on a different day can make such a difference. I also was more aware of making sure my portfolio has my own style embedded into it. Too many times I copy something without adding my own flavour to it. I'm hoping that will come more natually once I have a better grasp of programming in general.

### Day 4: May 25, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and did some research on Vue.js frameworks.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't do as much hard-coding as I would haved liked, the bulk of my time today was researching and learning the Vue.js framework. I met with a mentor and friend today, who I shared my summer goals of learning to code with, he was very supportive and we talked code. Sharing my aspirations with others really gives it a sense of meaning and validates that I'm doing the right thing.

### Day 5: May 26, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 22 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, these were on basic JavaScript. I also started working on a personal coding project, a talent quick guide for when I play Heroes of the Storm.

**Thoughts:** I know, my personal project is pretty nerdy, but I read some FreeCodeCamp medium articles, and they all seem to suggest building personal projects. These give you the best experience, as you think of a problem and try to solve it with code. My 'problem' was that I tend to google the best character builds just before a match. Since I use the same site everytime, why not code a mobile-responsive website with all the information I need at my fingertips. I knew I had the basic skills to code it, as there is no backend or scripting required, it seems like a perfect first project.

### Day 6: May 27, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 52 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was on fire today! The JavaScript exercises just clicked and I as able to breeze through the majority of them. I was struggling a little bit with the arrays, as I always have with using Processing at school. I have a feeling that the basic scripting exercises will be array based, I'm hoping my learning today can be retained for later use.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

***

### Day 7: May 28, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These set of exercises were the intro to object oriented programming, another aspect of Processing I struggled with. The exercises were very basic, and I hoping there are more to learn at FreeCodeCamp. Otherwise, I will have to work on them on my own some more.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

***

### Day 8: May 29, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 9 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These exercises also revolved around arrays, the bane of my existence. Once I am confident manipulating and leveraging the power of arrays, in some way, I will feel that I have made tremendous progress on my journey of learning to code. These examples are simple to do, but once I look up other examples online, I need to spend much more time dissecting and learning how they function.

### Day 9: May 30, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** So it begins. The deaded chapter of basic algorithm scripting. I've been coding with Processing for about 3 years (on and off), and algorithm scripting is something I've always struggled with. No matter, I will take them one at a time. There seems to be a trend where I can figure out how the function should be laid out, it's just the proper formatting and order of things I need more practice on.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

### Day 10: May 31, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to give myself a little confidence boost by working on the jQuery chapter on FreeCodeCamp. This module was only 2 hours to complete, and learning the new syntax was exciting. Working on the JavaScript was advanced for me, learning something at the early stages always boosts my confidence.

### Day 11: June 01, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and began my developmentNotes GitHub repo.

**Thoughts:** I went back to the JavaScript algorithms and had the same experience as before. Slow as steady, thinking I'm making steady progress, when I fall short 90% of the way in. I did some research online, and it seems that, as long as I take the time and care to really understand where I'm falling short, there's no reason why I can't look for help. After all, the Read-Search-Ask methodology is heavily advertised all over the coding community. My development notes repo is where I will be storing all the coding techniques I've come across and used. My reasoning to start this was after my struggles on the algorithms, I had no organized way to look back on what I've learned, and I certainly can't remember everything off the top of my head. These notes will also develop my familiarity with GitHub, another skill I need to learn!

***

### Day 12: June 02, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and completed a 4 video tutorial on Vue.js

**Thoughts:** After spending a considerable amount of time on merely 3 algorihtm exercises, I wanted a change of pace without jumping too far on FreeCodeCamp. My mentor sent me a YouTube playlist of an intro to Vue.js (only about an hour in total). I went through these videos with ease, as the Vue.js framework was designed to have jQuery capabilities with much less coding syntax needed.

***

### Day 13: June 03, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today felt like one of those "just going through the motions" days. Although I did spend a lot of time on a low amount of exercises. The majority of my time was searching through forums and learning the several new coding techniques that I need, but wasn't exposed to, in order to complete the algorithm exercises. Yet another validation of my developmentNotes wiki. It's taking a while to go through all the code I've already learned and place it in the wiki, cannot wait to be up to date on that!

***

### Day 14: June 04, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Now, today felt like a repeat of yesterday with a twist, I had a positive attitude. Yesterday, I felt discouraged for basically needing the coding community to hold my hand every step of the way for the exercises I wanted to complete. Today, I felt that the coding community had my back and encouraged my to push through the tough times. I hope for one day that I can be the one who answers the questions on the forums, some day. I also won't provide link updates on my wiki everytime I made a contribution, that might become a little redundant. Only when I either make a major change or addition, will I address it in this log.

### Day 15: June 05, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Forked my first repo (100DaysOfCode), and made some major updates to my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Maybe it's just me, but I've always loved Mondays. A fresh start to the working week, time to set goals, get organized, and start working. Today, I took a little break from FreeCodeCamp and focused on my action plans for taking my coding to the next level. I came across the 100DaysOfCode challenge and instantly wanted to be a part of it. Looking back at my coding history, I'm actually on day 15 of coding at least 1 hour every day! Today is no different, but I officially made my pledge to commit to the challenge. After some discouragement from the FreeCodeCamp algorithms, I felt the need to complete at least 1 exercise a day to get that calendar contribution box to go green. I've finally realized how silly that was. Why basically skip an exercise just to prove that I 'coded' that day? The 100DaysOfCode is perfect! Forking the repo, and keeping a log keeps me accountable for how I spend my coding time. Here's to 85 more days of learning to code!

### Day 16: June 06, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress updating my development notes wiki (completed Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, and the majority of Basic JavaScript], and completed 50 exercises on the Mimo app.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to ensure that what I learned so far on FreeCodeCamp was being retained in my head. My biggest contributions today was going over the JavaScript module for my wiki. Just the process of re-reading the exercies and jotting down the notes somewhere really helps. Whenever I came across an exercise that didn't blatantly give away the answer, I would redo it to see if I retained the information. I also tried out the Premium version of the Mimo app, a mobile app that teaches you to code (think Duolingo for coding). It's pretty fun, and has it's own style to teaching, but I think I'll keep my programming to the computer for now.

### Day 17: June 07, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the Basic JavaSript FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I really found going over all the exercises for JavaScript effective for retaining the information. The first time I went through the exercises, I needed to find help in forums, especially nearing the end of the module. The second time around, this time writing down the notes and understanding before jumping into the code really helped me figure it out on my own. I can't wait to be up to date on my developmentNotes wiki, so I can just update it in tandem with working on exercises, that way I no longer have to double back.

***

### Day 18: June 08, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Although this was a shorter chapter, I spend a lot of time and care going through the exercises. The next chapter is the slgorithm one, where I had a lot of trouble. But backtracking through this module really helped learn more about how objects were used in the next chapter. I hoping this extra effort of learning is retained for the more advanced modules of coding.

***

### Day 19: June 09, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the JSON APIs and Ajax FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to complete the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript modules before diving in (yet again) to the algorithm scripting modules. I remembered that JSONs were JavaScript based, and focused on objects, something I needed more practice with. Going over these exercises again helped better understand these objects.

***

### Day 20: June 10, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started a new CodePen project, where I practised with the Bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts:** I had many difficulties with the first FreeCodeCamp front end projects, such as developing a perfonal portfolio webpage. I kept struggling with Bootstrap for some reason. I just thought it was because I've never encountered this before. Apparently, I kept importing the 4.0 beta version, where the documentation I was referencing from was the 3.0. As soon as I corrected which version of Bootstrap I was working with, it became a breeze! It was realy fun trying out some layout examples.

***

### Day 21: June 11, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and read through the Bootstrap documentation.

**Thoughts:** My efforts on Bootstrap were slow but steady. I really wanted to ensure that every bit of code I was using, I understood. I noticed a trend that once my code gets beyond a certain length, things happen in the code that I can't explain. I really don't want to continue with that approach, so I made sure to take the extra time when implementing any part of the Bootstrap framework into my project.

***

### Day 22: June 12, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and read through the Bootstrap documentation.

**Thoughts:** Today was almost identical to yesterday. It was my convocation ceremony today (graduating from the New Media program at Ryerson University), so I didn't have too much time to myself for coding. I did, however, continue to read up on the Bootstrap framework, and altered the goal of the project to merge with my Bootstrap test with my Heroes of the Storm Talent Quick Pick guide. Seeing that I've dedicated some time to learning the layout part of Bootstrap, I will then apply it to my other projects.

***

### Day 23: June 13, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and transitioned it to my Heroes of the Storm project.

**Thoughts:** I continued working on my Bootstrap project, which then became my Heroes of the Storm project. I was more comfortable working with the layouts and decided to use this as the foundation for my personal project. There are a lot of characters to add, and I'm not experienced enough to script anything fancy just yet. I want something stable that works, so will continue to work on it this way, then simplify the code once I'm comfortable with the advanced code required.

***

### Day 24: June 14, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Heroes of the Storm Talent Quick Pick CodePen project, and also completed all of the notes of the Basic Algorithm Scripting FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Finishing up my CodePen project was a great feeling, although I believe that these kinds of projects can never be fully completed. There are always ways to improve the code, refine the design, and add features. For now, this project satisfies my goals in created a mobile-friendly character reference guide for Heroes of the Storm. I had some extra time today, so I added all of my notes from the Basic Algorithm Scripting FreeCodeCamp module to my developmentNotes wiki. Now, I am fully up to date on my FreeCodeCamp. I look forward to really diving into the Intermediate Front End projects tomorrow!

### Day 25: June 15, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made steady progress on FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine project.

**Thoughts:** I was nervous to start this exercise because I knew it required jQuery to connect to an API and get the JSON objects. That entire sentence consisted of coding skills I had never exercised in practise before. However, I took it one step at a time and made great progress, I was really proud of myself. I searched far and wide in many forums (even tried out asking a question on stackoverflow and got a grasp of what I needed to get this challenge done. I completed the quote generating part, I just need to finish some cosmetic tweaks and add the option to tweet out the quote.

***

### Day 26: June 16, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine project, and started on the FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather app.

**Thoughts:** I was in the zone today! Every feature I wanted to add to my project was actually working out. It was really great working on this project. I had never thought I would be successfully using jQuery on my first project, but reading through all the documentation online and applying it to a project really helped. I also started on the next project, making a Local Weather web app. I want to make a cloud-like shape with divs, that is proving to be harder than expected, but I want to power through it.

***

### Day 27: June 17, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather app.

**Thoughts:** I continued refining the design for my weather app, tweaking the look and gathering all the necessary background images from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/). Today mostly focused on getting the look and design done before working on the more complex API part. I'm hoping that will go smoothly tomorrow.

***

### Day 28: June 18, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather app.

**Thoughts:** Most of my time coding today was figuring out how to connect to the Dark Sky API for this project. I searched endlessly online, and did find lots of great help. Unfortunately, all the solutions to other people's problems just weren't working for me. I understood that getting the geolocation from the user's browser is an asynchronous method, so I coded it to request after it received the geolocation, but it still never worked. It was only until I went on to the FreeCodeCamp's gitter chat, where the community there was able to find a solution! Always great to know the community has your back if you get stuck. I'm looking forward to (hopefully) completing this project tomorrow.

***

### Day 29: June 19, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather project.

**Thoughts:** My local weather app is complete! Most of the functionality was sorted out yesterday, today was more refining the styling and look of it. Always a good feeling completing a larger project and have it work exactly how you wanted it. I also started looking into the next FreeCodeCamp project, building a Wikipedia viewer. Later in the day, a friend of mine may be able to get me an interview at a company where I would need to know some backend languages. That being said, I may just start on the backend module of FreeCodeCamp, to learn what I need in time for an interview.

***

### Day 30: June 20, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today I focused on learning some important backend skills that may be needed for a potential job. That is why I jumped right into FreeCodeCamp's beginning exercises for the back end certification, testing and debugging, and an introduction to Git. The testing was extremely short, and just introduced the JavaScript developer console log, but that did segway nicely into the Git exercise. This was externally hosted as the Git-it [tutorial](http://jlord.us/git-it/). I already had some experience with Git from my days at Ryerson, but it was nice fun to learn it in a different way.

### Day 31: June 21, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 10 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I began Codecademy's Learn SQL module today, and completed the first section on the manipulation of databases. It seemed simple enough, I had used SQL (with a lot of help) a few years back, so the language was pretty familiar. It does help that the language is very english-esque, I hoping learning this will help with what I may need to know for the potential job.

***

### Day 32: June 22, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 29 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I completed Codecademy's Learn SQL module today. I really enjoy how simple the code is, yet it can be very powerful since it references and manipulates databases. I excited to apply this code in a project to witness the functionality first hand. I don't have access to Codecademy's projects or tests because I don't have the premium subscription. That is something I found is missing from learning coding online, all the resources I've come across don't help you with coding that newly learned language on your own. I remember learning JavaScript in Codecademy. I completed the module, but did not learn where to code JavaScript. Back then, I knew basic JavaSCript, but no idea where or how to actually code it into a website project, for example. I'm at that point with SQL now, I know the basic language, but where do I actually code it? Inside my HTML code, in CSS, in JavaScript? Where do I even get online hosting to host a database, how do I host multiple tables? I know I can just Google all these questions, but I still believe online courses should help direct beginners to additional resources.

***

### Day 33: June 23, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 12 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I began Codecademy's SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics module, since the description seems quite similar to what I will be doing should I get an interview for that position. This module is more advanced than the previous one, and I did have some difficulty with a few of the exercises. The coding still makes sense, but the syntax is incredibly different from what I used to, so it will take a while for me to learn how to think in this language.

### Days Missed (4): June 24, 25, 26, 27, 2017

**Reason**: On vacation.

***

### Day 34: June 28, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 14 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I completed Codecademy's SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics module today. I was nervous that being away from code for a few days would wipe my brain clean of my little knowledge of SQL. Fortunately, I read through my developmentNotes before diving into the second half of this module, and I think this really helped. I got through the majority of the exercises with ease, and it was all making sense. Then I needed a little help, something I've noticed with Codecademy's learning structure. If there are 3 parts to an exercise, and you are stuck on the first part, requesting the code hint will provide the final answer to the third part. Meaning I won't know how the first or second part was supposed to be written. Then I try to search the exercise online, and I can't find a breakdown of the exercise. This system seems broken to me, they should provide you with step by step information for each part of an exercise, not just the end-goal.

### Day 35: June 29, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts:** Despite reading through the extensive Wikipedia API documentation and feeling overwhelmed from the start, I am proud to have completed this project in a single day. I do believe I am getting more comfortable getting objects from APIs and manipulating them to develop functional and stylistic web apps. I thorougly enjoyed formulating the steps I required to complete the project, and work iterate through them slowly and steadily. Ensuring I am actually learning how things work when I needed to search a forum or YouTube video to help guide me.

***

### Day 36: June 30, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** Today I began the final FreeCodeCamp intermediate front end development project, creating a Twitch.tv streamer viewer. It was a slow start in figuring out how to call the data since the API now requires an authentication key, but FreeCodeCamp provided information to bypass that. Once I got it working, I made steady progress. I'm very excited that it's becoming more and more common that all my code is intentional, and I use my previous projects and exercises as reference to help guide me, rather than searching online.

***

### Day 37: July 01, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I continued working on this project today. I thought this project was of similar nature to the Wikipedia Viewer project, however this one is a bit more complicated with the client ID work around and other JavaScript code needed. I was having difficulty trying to make my code more effecient by iterating through an array of streamers. I always have trouble when for loops and other math items are required. Fortunately, I did make steady progress and am learning as I go. It's tempting to just bail and write everything by hand, but I'm more than willing to spend the time to work this out, as I can see the potential of automating and iterating through objects and arrays.

***

### Day 38: July 02, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I had some more trouble with the API calling again today, something about iterating through a for loop to populate four streamer divs with four separate getJSON calls. They all successfully go through, and I can pull the data and manipulate it. The only problem is that the array of streamers that are called back are in a random order every time. I'm assuming they are all called in order, but the order of when each getJSON is completed is random. It's not a big deal that this happens, but I wouldn't want this outcome for another type of project, so I'm still figuring out a way around this.

***

### Day 39: July 03, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I am very proud of how this project was completed, I must say. I was struggling with the getJSON aspect of the code, and how if you try to call it twice, sometimes one is completed before the other. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to code a way to wait for each getJSON to be complete to then use the data, and it was all settled with a simple return function. I am very happy to have found a solution and successfully implemented it! I also used iterating functions that cut my code in half, and makes it easier to scale (great for future projects). Overall, I learned a great deal of how to think like a programmer, and I can't wait to apply my new skills in the future!

### Day 40: July 04, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Ahh, back to good ole scripting exercises, the bane of my existence for programming. These set of exercises are intermediate, and it really shows. I was only able to complete and understand three today because they took me so long. For each exercise today, I would attempt my own code, formulating some pseudocode to answer the exercise, then try the actual syntax. I am able to understand the logic needed for each script, I just stumble on the exact syntax to make it work. This made my worried if I'm just not learning code, despite my successful front end projects and building my portfolio of functioning web apps. I then had a chat with a good friend of mine who is a developer, and she assured me that everyone stuggles with exact syntax, and that if I can at least figure out the logic and understand the pseudocode before searching the answer, I am learning. Repetition of using the correct syntax while understanding what it does, is learning. This gave me more confidence to push forward on these scripting exercises.

### Day 41: July 05, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** More algorithm scripting today. It did help workout out the pseudocode before attempting the proper syntax in a sense. It validated that I am able to pretty much solve what the script needs to perform in order to achieve the intended results. I am still required to search for help online with the proper syntax. Here's hoping that I am learning and that practice will make it easier each time.

### Day 42: July 06, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, updated my developmentNotes wiki, and created a virtual server for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I completed a few algorithms today, but I just wasn't feeling it. I was just going through the motions, and I wanted to complete something tangible today. That is why I created a virtual server for a project I'm working on, Curated Canvas. This process took a very long time today. Many YouTube tutorials, online forums, and asking friends, but I am very proud that I was able to do all this and successfully implement everything: Created an Ubuntu Linux EC2 instance on AWS, SSH'd to it and installed the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu, connected to the server via FileZilla, FTP'd a tester index.html page, and connected a subdomain to the instance DNS. Talk about a busy day! I look forward to at least trying my own code for this project, but before diving right in, I'll probably learn more about GitHub and version control to better understand how to back up my code.

### Day 43: July 07, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, updated my developmentNotes wiki, and updated the landing page of Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I completed a few more algorithms today, but was more interested in working on Curated Canvas since that was a new experience. I updated the landing page with some basic text and some re-directing links, nothing special. Just setting up the stylesheet and whatnot. I did a lot of researching online of how to properly use GitHub for managing a project. I completed an online tutorial and created a private repo for Curated Canvas. I was able to make it private because I applied for and was accepted for the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Can't wait to take advantage of all the great perks that comes with it, I'm sure they will help with my pursuit of learning code.

### Day 44: July 08, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have a decent internet connection for the weekend, so I decided to develop Curated Canvas log in page locally. This gave me a chance to learn how to properly load scripts such as jQuery, Font Awesome, and Animate.css. It was really fun working on the webpage, especially since I had designed all the pages beforehand on Adobe XD. Lots of html and css coding today, always a good time when things work properly! Here's hoping that once I transfer the files from my local machine to the server, it doesn't mess things up!

### Day 45: July 09, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the log in and sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** In the same boat today as yesterday, so I continued working on my local html and css. Today, I was having a lot of difficulty working on the jQuery and JavaScript. Turns out I wasn't using the proper script for either the script.js or animate.css. Once that was figured out, the rest came pretty easily to me. I would add a link to my work, however the connection over here is too slow for FileZilla to properly connect to my EC2 server. We'll all just have to be patient here.

### Day 46: July 10, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** I decided to change things up a bit and learn some PHP for both Curated Canvas and just as another programming language to add to my toolbelt. I applied as a research assistant for the upcoming fall semester that is looking for someone who knows PHP, figured its a good time to start learning this. So far so good, most of what I am learning now overlaps what I already know from HTML and JavaScript, but reviewing is still being productive.

### Day 47: July 11, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** I continued working on the PHP module on Codecademy. My internet connect wasn't the greatest today, so I wasn't able to complete as many exercised as I would have liked. The exercises are still somewhat of a review of what I already know, such the syntax for arrays.

### Day 48: July 12, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 17 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** Same boat as yesterday, completed a whole bunch of PHP exercises on Codecademy with limited internet. Now, I'm not sure if it's my connection issues, but typing in the Codecademy terminal is a nightmare! If I try to type in quotations, it moves my cursor around the page! I need to type out my code in a text editor, then copy-paste it into the Codecademy terminal, only then it sometimes work. Sometimes the code only works once I've copy-pasted the correct code from the Codecademy answer help (even if it's the exact same as my own code). Weird...

### Day 49: July 13, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 8 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** Today I completed first section of PHP functions. It's interesting how similar this language is to HTML, with little differences in the syntax. I looking forward to implement this language in action with Curated Canvas, seems like there is a lot of potential here.

### Day 50: July 14, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I decided to shake things up and go back to working on Curated Canvas offline today. I wanted to write some code in an editor that worked, rather than learn about PHP syntax. I figured I will wait until I am back home (with better internet) to test my newly acquired PHP skills. Today I worked on the sign up page, just formatting it to match the sign in page, coming along very nicely.
