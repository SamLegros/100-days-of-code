### Day 1: May 22, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I have a pretty good grasp of HTML5 and CSS, I hope this translates well with JavaScript. I have been working on exercises on FreeCodeCamp for about 2 weeks now, today is the day I begin to code everyday without (fingers crossed) missing a day! I'm very excited to work on this challenge!

### Day 2: May 23, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and began working on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I was having difficulty putting a navigation bar at the top of my window that stays on top of the content. I'm wondering if Bootstrap is acting up, or my programming skills aren't up to par. I went through many websites and forums for help, still no luck with the responsive formatting, I'm hoping tomorrow will yield better results.

### Day 3: May 24, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and make some progress on my Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** Today was a much better day for coding. Just trying the same problem again on a different day can make such a difference. I also was more aware of making sure my portfolio has my own style embedded into it. Too many times I copy something without adding my own flavour to it. I'm hoping that will come more natually once I have a better grasp of programming in general.

### Day 4: May 25, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and did some research on Vue.js frameworks.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't do as much hard-coding as I would haved liked, the bulk of my time today was researching and learning the Vue.js framework. I met with a mentor and friend today, who I shared my summer goals of learning to code with, he was very supportive and we talked code. Sharing my aspirations with others really gives it a sense of meaning and validates that I'm doing the right thing.

### Day 5: May 26, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 22 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, these were on basic JavaScript. I also started working on a personal coding project, a talent quick guide for when I play Heroes of the Storm.

**Thoughts:** I know, my personal project is pretty nerdy, but I read some FreeCodeCamp medium articles, and they all seem to suggest building personal projects. These give you the best experience, as you think of a problem and try to solve it with code. My 'problem' was that I tend to google the best character builds just before a match. Since I use the same site everytime, why not code a mobile-responsive website with all the information I need at my fingertips. I knew I had the basic skills to code it, as there is no backend or scripting required, it seems like a perfect first project.

### Day 6: May 27, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 52 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was on fire today! The JavaScript exercises just clicked and I as able to breeze through the majority of them. I was struggling a little bit with the arrays, as I always have with using Processing at school. I have a feeling that the basic scripting exercises will be array based, I'm hoping my learning today can be retained for later use.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

***

### Day 7: May 28, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These set of exercises were the intro to object oriented programming, another aspect of Processing I struggled with. The exercises were very basic, and I hoping there are more to learn at FreeCodeCamp. Otherwise, I will have to work on them on my own some more.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

***

### Day 8: May 29, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 9 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** These exercises also revolved around arrays, the bane of my existence. Once I am confident manipulating and leveraging the power of arrays, in some way, I will feel that I have made tremendous progress on my journey of learning to code. These examples are simple to do, but once I look up other examples online, I need to spend much more time dissecting and learning how they function.

### Day 9: May 30, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** So it begins. The deaded chapter of basic algorithm scripting. I've been coding with Processing for about 3 years (on and off), and algorithm scripting is something I've always struggled with. No matter, I will take them one at a time. There seems to be a trend where I can figure out how the function should be laid out, it's just the proper formatting and order of things I need more practice on.

**Link(s) to work:** Null

### Day 10: May 31, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to give myself a little confidence boost by working on the jQuery chapter on FreeCodeCamp. This module was only 2 hours to complete, and learning the new syntax was exciting. Working on the JavaScript was advanced for me, learning something at the early stages always boosts my confidence.

### Day 11: June 01, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and began my developmentNotes GitHub repo.

**Thoughts:** I went back to the JavaScript algorithms and had the same experience as before. Slow as steady, thinking I'm making steady progress, when I fall short 90% of the way in. I did some research online, and it seems that, as long as I take the time and care to really understand where I'm falling short, there's no reason why I can't look for help. After all, the Read-Search-Ask methodology is heavily advertised all over the coding community. My development notes repo is where I will be storing all the coding techniques I've come across and used. My reasoning to start this was after my struggles on the algorithms, I had no organized way to look back on what I've learned, and I certainly can't remember everything off the top of my head. These notes will also develop my familiarity with GitHub, another skill I need to learn!

***

### Day 12: June 02, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and completed a 4 video tutorial on Vue.js

**Thoughts:** After spending a considerable amount of time on merely 3 algorihtm exercises, I wanted a change of pace without jumping too far on FreeCodeCamp. My mentor sent me a YouTube playlist of an intro to Vue.js (only about an hour in total). I went through these videos with ease, as the Vue.js framework was designed to have jQuery capabilities with much less coding syntax needed.

### Day 13: June 03, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today felt like one of those "just going through the motions" days. Although I did spend a lot of time on a low amount of exercises. The majority of my time was searching through forums and learning the several new coding techniques that I need, but wasn't exposed to, in order to complete the algorithm exercises. Yet another validation of my developmentNotes wiki. It's taking a while to go through all the code I've already learned and place it in the wiki, cannot wait to be up to date on that!

***

### Day 14: June 04, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Now, today felt like a repeat of yesterday with a twist, I had a positive attitude. Yesterday, I felt discouraged for basically needing the coding community to hold my hand every step of the way for the exercises I wanted to complete. Today, I felt that the coding community had my back and encouraged my to push through the tough times. I hope for one day that I can be the one who answers the questions on the forums, some day. I also won't provide link updates on my wiki everytime I made a contribution, that might become a little redundant. Only when I either make a major change or addition, will I address it in this log.

### Day 15: June 05, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Forked my first repo (100DaysOfCode), and made some major updates to my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Maybe it's just me, but I've always loved Mondays. A fresh start to the working week, time to set goals, get organized, and start working. Today, I took a little break from FreeCodeCamp and focused on my action plans for taking my coding to the next level. I came across the 100DaysOfCode challenge and instantly wanted to be a part of it. Looking back at my coding history, I'm actually on day 15 of coding at least 1 hour every day! Today is no different, but I officially made my pledge to commit to the challenge. After some discouragement from the FreeCodeCamp algorithms, I felt the need to complete at least 1 exercise a day to get that calendar contribution box to go green. I've finally realized how silly that was. Why basically skip an exercise just to prove that I 'coded' that day? The 100DaysOfCode is perfect! Forking the repo, and keeping a log keeps me accountable for how I spend my coding time. Here's to 85 more days of learning to code!

### Day 16: June 06, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress updating my development notes wiki (completed Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, and the majority of Basic JavaScript], and completed 50 exercises on the Mimo app.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to ensure that what I learned so far on FreeCodeCamp was being retained in my head. My biggest contributions today was going over the JavaScript module for my wiki. Just the process of re-reading the exercies and jotting down the notes somewhere really helps. Whenever I came across an exercise that didn't blatantly give away the answer, I would redo it to see if I retained the information. I also tried out the Premium version of the Mimo app, a mobile app that teaches you to code (think Duolingo for coding). It's pretty fun, and has it's own style to teaching, but I think I'll keep my programming to the computer for now.

### Day 17: June 07, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the Basic JavaSript FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I really found going over all the exercises for JavaScript effective for retaining the information. The first time I went through the exercises, I needed to find help in forums, especially nearing the end of the module. The second time around, this time writing down the notes and understanding before jumping into the code really helped me figure it out on my own. I can't wait to be up to date on my developmentNotes wiki, so I can just update it in tandem with working on exercises, that way I no longer have to double back.

### Day 18: June 08, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Although this was a shorter chapter, I spend a lot of time and care going through the exercises. The next chapter is the slgorithm one, where I had a lot of trouble. But backtracking through this module really helped learn more about how objects were used in the next chapter. I hoping this extra effort of learning is retained for the more advanced modules of coding.

***

### Day 19: June 09, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the notes of the JSON APIs and Ajax FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to complete the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript modules before diving in (yet again) to the algorithm scripting modules. I remembered that JSONs were JavaScript based, and focused on objects, something I needed more practice with. Going over these exercises again helped better understand these objects.

***

### Day 20: June 10, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started a new CodePen project, where I practised with the Bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts:** I had many difficulties with the first FreeCodeCamp front end projects, such as developing a perfonal portfolio webpage. I kept struggling with Bootstrap for some reason. I just thought it was because I've never encountered this before. Apparently, I kept importing the 4.0 beta version, where the documentation I was referencing from was the 3.0. As soon as I corrected which version of Bootstrap I was working with, it became a breeze! It was realy fun trying out some layout examples.

***

### Day 21: June 11, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and read through the Bootstrap documentation.

**Thoughts:** My efforts on Bootstrap were slow but steady. I really wanted to ensure that every bit of code I was using, I understood. I noticed a trend that once my code gets beyond a certain length, things happen in the code that I can't explain. I really don't want to continue with that approach, so I made sure to take the extra time when implementing any part of the Bootstrap framework into my project.

***

### Day 22: June 12, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and read through the Bootstrap documentation.

**Thoughts:** Today was almost identical to yesterday. It was my convocation ceremony today (graduating from the New Media program at Ryerson University), so I didn't have too much time to myself for coding. I did, however, continue to read up on the Bootstrap framework, and altered the goal of the project to merge with my Bootstrap test with my Heroes of the Storm Talent Quick Pick guide. Seeing that I've dedicated some time to learning the layout part of Bootstrap, I will then apply it to my other projects.

***

### Day 23: June 13, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on my Bootstrap CodePen project, and transitioned it to my Heroes of the Storm project.

**Thoughts:** I continued working on my Bootstrap project, which then became my Heroes of the Storm project. I was more comfortable working with the layouts and decided to use this as the foundation for my personal project. There are a lot of characters to add, and I'm not experienced enough to script anything fancy just yet. I want something stable that works, so will continue to work on it this way, then simplify the code once I'm comfortable with the advanced code required.

***

### Day 24: June 14, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Heroes of the Storm Talent Quick Pick CodePen project, and also completed all of the notes of the Basic Algorithm Scripting FreeCodeCamp module for my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Finishing up my CodePen project was a great feeling, although I believe that these kinds of projects can never be fully completed. There are always ways to improve the code, refine the design, and add features. For now, this project satisfies my goals in created a mobile-friendly character reference guide for Heroes of the Storm. I had some extra time today, so I added all of my notes from the Basic Algorithm Scripting FreeCodeCamp module to my developmentNotes wiki. Now, I am fully up to date on my FreeCodeCamp. I look forward to really diving into the Intermediate Front End projects tomorrow!

### Day 25: June 15, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made steady progress on FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine project.

**Thoughts:** I was nervous to start this exercise because I knew it required jQuery to connect to an API and get the JSON objects. That entire sentence consisted of coding skills I had never exercised in practise before. However, I took it one step at a time and made great progress, I was really proud of myself. I searched far and wide in many forums (even tried out asking a question on stackoverflow and got a grasp of what I needed to get this challenge done. I completed the quote generating part, I just need to finish some cosmetic tweaks and add the option to tweet out the quote.

***

### Day 26: June 16, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine project, and started on the FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather project.

**Thoughts:** I was in the zone today! Every feature I wanted to add to my project was actually working out. It was really great working on this project. I had never thought I would be successfully using jQuery on my first project, but reading through all the documentation online and applying it to a project really helped. I also started on the next project, making a Local Weather web app. I want to make a cloud-like shape with divs, that is proving to be harder than expected, but I want to power through it.

***

### Day 27: June 17, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather project.

**Thoughts:** I continued refining the design for my weather app, tweaking the look and gathering all the necessary background images from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/). Today mostly focused on getting the look and design done before working on the more complex API part. I'm hoping that will go smoothly tomorrow.

***

### Day 28: June 18, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather project.

**Thoughts:** Most of my time coding today was figuring out how to connect to the Dark Sky API for this project. I searched endlessly online, and did find lots of great help. Unfortunately, all the solutions to other people's problems just weren't working for me. I understood that getting the geolocation from the user's browser is an asynchronous method, so I coded it to request after it received the geolocation, but it still never worked. It was only until I went on to the FreeCodeCamp's gitter chat, where the community there was able to find a solution! Always great to know the community has your back if you get stuck. I'm looking forward to (hopefully) completing this project tomorrow.

***

### Day 29: June 19, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Local Weather project.

**Thoughts:** My local weather app is complete! Most of the functionality was sorted out yesterday, today was more refining the styling and look of it. Always a good feeling completing a larger project and have it work exactly how you wanted it. I also started looking into the next FreeCodeCamp project, building a Wikipedia viewer. Later in the day, a friend of mine may be able to get me an interview at a company where I would need to know some backend languages. That being said, I may just start on the backend module of FreeCodeCamp, to learn what I need in time for an interview.

***

### Day 30: June 20, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today I focused on learning some important backend skills that may be needed for a potential job. That is why I jumped right into FreeCodeCamp's beginning exercises for the back end certification, testing and debugging, and an introduction to Git. The testing was extremely short, and just introduced the JavaScript developer console log, but that did segway nicely into the Git exercise. This was externally hosted as the Git-it [tutorial](http://jlord.us/git-it/). I already had some experience with Git from my days at Ryerson, but it was nice fun to learn it in a different way.

### Day 31: June 21, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 10 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I began Codecademy's Learn SQL module today, and completed the first section on the manipulation of databases. It seemed simple enough, I had used SQL (with a lot of help) a few years back, so the language was pretty familiar. It does help that the language is very english-esque, I hoping learning this will help with what I may need to know for the potential job.

***

### Day 32: June 22, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 29 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I completed Codecademy's Learn SQL module today. I really enjoy how simple the code is, yet it can be very powerful since it references and manipulates databases. I excited to apply this code in a project to witness the functionality first hand. I don't have access to Codecademy's projects or tests because I don't have the premium subscription. That is something I found is missing from learning coding online, all the resources I've come across don't help you with coding that newly learned language on your own. I remember learning JavaScript in Codecademy. I completed the module, but did not learn where to code JavaScript. Back then, I knew basic JavaSCript, but no idea where or how to actually code it into a website project, for example. I'm at that point with SQL now, I know the basic language, but where do I actually code it? Inside my HTML code, in CSS, in JavaScript? Where do I even get online hosting to host a database, how do I host multiple tables? I know I can just Google all these questions, but I still believe online courses should help direct beginners to additional resources.

***

### Day 33: June 23, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 12 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I began Codecademy's SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics module, since the description seems quite similar to what I will be doing should I get an interview for that position. This module is more advanced than the previous one, and I did have some difficulty with a few of the exercises. The coding still makes sense, but the syntax is incredibly different from what I used to, so it will take a while for me to learn how to think in this language.

### Days Missed (4): June 24, 25, 26, 27, 2017

**Reason**: On vacation.

***

### Day 34: June 28, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 14 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I completed Codecademy's SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics module today. I was nervous that being away from code for a few days would wipe my brain clean of my little knowledge of SQL. Fortunately, I read through my developmentNotes before diving into the second half of this module, and I think this really helped. I got through the majority of the exercises with ease, and it was all making sense. Then I needed a little help, something I've noticed with Codecademy's learning structure. If there are 3 parts to an exercise, and you are stuck on the first part, requesting the code hint will provide the final answer to the third part. Meaning I won't know how the first or second part was supposed to be written. Then I try to search the exercise online, and I can't find a breakdown of the exercise. This system seems broken to me, they should provide you with step by step information for each part of an exercise, not just the end-goal.

### Day 35: June 29, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts:** Despite reading through the extensive Wikipedia API documentation and feeling overwhelmed from the start, I am proud to have completed this project in a single day. I do believe I am getting more comfortable getting objects from APIs and manipulating them to develop functional and stylistic web apps. I thorougly enjoyed formulating the steps I required to complete the project, and work iterate through them slowly and steadily. Ensuring I am actually learning how things work when I needed to search a forum or YouTube video to help guide me.

***

### Day 36: June 30, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** Today I began the final FreeCodeCamp intermediate front end development project, creating a Twitch.tv streamer viewer. It was a slow start in figuring out how to call the data since the API now requires an authentication key, but FreeCodeCamp provided information to bypass that. Once I got it working, I made steady progress. I'm very excited that it's becoming more and more common that all my code is intentional, and I use my previous projects and exercises as reference to help guide me, rather than searching online.

***

### Day 37: July 01, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I continued working on this project today. I thought this project was of similar nature to the Wikipedia Viewer project, however this one is a bit more complicated with the client ID work around and other JavaScript code needed. I was having difficulty trying to make my code more effecient by iterating through an array of streamers. I always have trouble when for loops and other math items are required. Fortunately, I did make steady progress and am learning as I go. It's tempting to just bail and write everything by hand, but I'm more than willing to spend the time to work this out, as I can see the potential of automating and iterating through objects and arrays.

***

### Day 38: July 02, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I had some more trouble with the API calling again today, something about iterating through a for loop to populate four streamer divs with four separate getJSON calls. They all successfully go through, and I can pull the data and manipulate it. The only problem is that the array of streamers that are called back are in a random order every time. I'm assuming they are all called in order, but the order of when each getJSON is completed is random. It's not a big deal that this happens, but I wouldn't want this outcome for another type of project, so I'm still figuring out a way around this.

***

### Day 39: July 03, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv project.

**Thoughts:** I am very proud of how this project was completed, I must say. I was struggling with the getJSON aspect of the code, and how if you try to call it twice, sometimes one is completed before the other. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to code a way to wait for each getJSON to be complete to then use the data, and it was all settled with a simple return function. I am very happy to have found a solution and successfully implemented it! I also used iterating functions that cut my code in half, and makes it easier to scale (great for future projects). Overall, I learned a great deal of how to think like a programmer, and I can't wait to apply my new skills in the future!

### Day 40: July 04, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Ahh, back to good ole scripting exercises, the bane of my existence for programming. These set of exercises are intermediate, and it really shows. I was only able to complete and understand three today because they took me so long. For each exercise today, I would attempt my own code, formulating some pseudocode to answer the exercise, then try the actual syntax. I am able to understand the logic needed for each script, I just stumble on the exact syntax to make it work. This made my worried if I'm just not learning code, despite my successful front end projects and building my portfolio of functioning web apps. I then had a chat with a good friend of mine who is a developer, and she assured me that everyone stuggles with exact syntax, and that if I can at least figure out the logic and understand the pseudocode before searching the answer, I am learning. Repetition of using the correct syntax while understanding what it does, is learning. This gave me more confidence to push forward on these scripting exercises.

### Day 41: July 05, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** More algorithm scripting today. It did help workout out the pseudocode before attempting the proper syntax in a sense. It validated that I am able to pretty much solve what the script needs to perform in order to achieve the intended results. I am still required to search for help online with the proper syntax. Here's hoping that I am learning and that practice will make it easier each time.

### Day 42: July 06, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, updated my developmentNotes wiki, and created a virtual server for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I completed a few algorithms today, but I just wasn't feeling it. I was just going through the motions, and I wanted to complete something tangible today. That is why I created a virtual server for a project I'm working on, Curated Canvas. This process took a very long time today. Many YouTube tutorials, online forums, and asking friends, but I am very proud that I was able to do all this and successfully implement everything: Created an Ubuntu Linux EC2 instance on AWS, SSH'd to it and installed the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu, connected to the server via FileZilla, FTP'd a tester index.html page, and connected a subdomain to the instance DNS. Talk about a busy day! I look forward to at least trying my own code for this project, but before diving right in, I'll probably learn more about GitHub and version control to better understand how to back up my code.

### Day 43: July 07, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, updated my developmentNotes wiki, and updated the landing page of Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I completed a few more algorithms today, but was more interested in working on Curated Canvas since that was a new experience. I updated the landing page with some basic text and some re-directing links, nothing special. Just setting up the stylesheet and whatnot. I did a lot of researching online of how to properly use GitHub for managing a project. I completed an online tutorial and created a private repo for Curated Canvas. I was able to make it private because I applied for and was accepted for the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Can't wait to take advantage of all the great perks that comes with it, I'm sure they will help with my pursuit of learning code.

### Day 44: July 08, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have a decent internet connection for the weekend, so I decided to develop Curated Canvas log in page locally. This gave me a chance to learn how to properly load scripts such as jQuery, Font Awesome, and Animate.css. It was really fun working on the webpage, especially since I had designed all the pages beforehand on Adobe XD. Lots of html and css coding today, always a good time when things work properly! Here's hoping that once I transfer the files from my local machine to the server, it doesn't mess things up!

### Day 45: July 09, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the log in and sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** In the same boat today as yesterday, so I continued working on my local html and css. Today, I was having a lot of difficulty working on the jQuery and JavaScript. Turns out I wasn't using the proper script for either the script.js or animate.css. Once that was figured out, the rest came pretty easily to me. I would add a link to my work, however the connection over here is too slow for FileZilla to properly connect to my EC2 server. We'll all just have to be patient here.

### Day 46: July 10, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 23 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** I decided to change things up a bit and learn some PHP for both Curated Canvas and just as another programming language to add to my toolbelt. I applied as a research assistant for the upcoming fall semester that is looking for someone who knows PHP, figured its a good time to start learning this. So far so good, most of what I am learning now overlaps what I already know from HTML and JavaScript, but reviewing is still being productive.

### Day 47: July 11, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** I continued working on the PHP module on Codecademy. My internet connect wasn't the greatest today, so I wasn't able to complete as many exercised as I would have liked. The exercises are still somewhat of a review of what I already know, such the syntax for arrays.

### Day 48: July 12, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 17 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** Same boat as yesterday, completed a whole bunch of PHP exercises on Codecademy with limited internet. Now, I'm not sure if it's my connection issues, but typing in the Codecademy terminal is a nightmare! If I try to type in quotations, it moves my cursor around the page! I need to type out my code in a text editor, then copy-paste it into the Codecademy terminal, only then it sometimes work. Sometimes the code only works once I've copy-pasted the correct code from the Codecademy answer help (even if it's the exact same as my own code). Weird...

### Day 49: July 13, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 8 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** Today I completed first section of PHP functions. It's interesting how similar this language is to HTML, with little differences in the syntax. I looking forward to implement this language in action with Curated Canvas, seems like there is a lot of potential here.

### Day 50: July 14, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the sign up page for Curated Canvas.

**Thoughts:** I decided to shake things up and go back to working on Curated Canvas offline today. I wanted to write some code in an editor that worked, rather than learn about PHP syntax. I figured I will wait until I am back home (with better internet) to test my newly acquired PHP skills. Today I worked on the sign up page, just formatting it to match the sign in page, coming along very nicely.

### Day 51: July 15, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** I completed the second part of the Codecademy's PHP functions exercises. This was more of a review of the basic syntax and use for functions. However, it did take longer than expected because of the editor troubles on Codecademy, I basically can't type in apostrophes nor quotations. That being said, I would write my code in the text editor for this wiki, then copy-paste it into the editor. Unfortunately, for some reason, the code would only work half the time. When it wouldn't work, I would have to copy-paste the specific names of functions over my written code, even when the function names are the exact same! For example, if Codecademy was looking for me to make a function called squareValue, I would type that in this wiki, copy-paste the code (it wouldn't run properly). I would then have to copy the squareValue function from the exercise instruction text, and paste it over my squareValue function (that was written the exact same way), only then will the code work and allow me to proceed to the next exercise.

### Day 52: July 16, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 9 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** Today's exercises were regarding object-oriented programming in PHP. This was a great module as this type of coding is essential for many things, yet is quite complex and I have a history of having difficulty with it. The examples here were straightforward, and although the syntax differs slightly than that of JavaScript, the principles remain the same. Side note, I am back home where the internet connect is just fine, and I was still having issues with the Codecademy editor, meaning I still need to write the code here, then copy-paste it back to the editor. I'm not too worried, as I am almost done the PHP module.

### Day 53: July 17, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 8 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki

**Thoughts:** These exercices were the advanced iterations of OOP in PHP. It was going so smoothly, I understood everything (or so I thought), and knew the proper syntax, until the final 'put it all together' challenge. I went over my notes, revisited past exercises, but something was just not working. Turns out there was a single line of code that did not match the rest of my notes, where inside a child class, you apparently don't need the word public before a const variable. This was not outlined at all in the Codecademy notes. Meaning I will need to do some more research as to why that is.

### Day 54: July 18, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on Codecademy, updated my developmentNotes wiki, and updated Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** I completed the PHP module on Codecademy. Although I do feel that I learned a lot in terms of PHP syntax and how to manipulate the code, I still have this feeling of 'not really learning' the language. I felt this way before upon completing the HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript modules on Codecademy too. You know what is missing (well, it's not really missing. More like, what is missing that is free), it's actually implementing the newly acquired skill! I remember completing the JavaScript module and then thinking "okay, now how/where/why/when do I actually use JavaScript?". There was no mentioning that you can create a script.js file and then add the coding there to manipulate your html elements, for example. I had no idea what to do with JavaScript. This is where Free Code Camp does it so very well. You learn the language, and then you get concrete projects to exercise your knowledge! I absolutely love this model, where you can see a direct result of the newly acquired skills. I'm assuming this is possible with Codecademy, you just need to pay for it. Oh, I also ftp'd my Curated Canvas files to the server, so they are live and you can view the progress in the link below. I was so nervous that me developing them offline would have unintended effects upon being pushed to a live server, and when I did just that and refreshed the page, all the formatting was off! Turns out, I just needed to clear my cache, and everything looks and functions the way I wanted it to!

### Day 55: July 19, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a YouTube tutorial on creating a PHP/MySQL registration page for user sign ups.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial was a great starter for actually implementing PHP into an HTML page and seeing the results. This tutorial also explained how I can't just run php pages in a browser, I needed to setup some kind of server to test it on. In comes MAMP to save the day! Really easy to setup a local server to test your PHP/MySQL coding. Although I completed the tutotrial, I still feel like I'm missing a lot in important information to know about setting up MySQL specifically. I will probably go over a few more tutorials on this tomorrow.

### Day 56: July 20, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed several YouTube tutorials on creating a PHP/MySQL login and registration page for users.

**Thoughts:** Today was a bit more frustrating, as I had to spend a lot of time searching for a video tutorial that matched my level of knowledge of PHP and MySQL. I knew the basics, but still wanted one that walked us through all of the steps and explain the reasoning for each line of code. After many half-completed tutorials (mostly because I can follow the video up to a certain point, then when I try refreshing the PHP page, it just doesn't load. That's the frustrating part of PHP, if one thing doesn't work, it can't pinpoint the error for you), I finally came across one that had it all. Funnily enough, around 45 minutes into this one, I ran my page, and it didn't work! I was so upset! I had to rewatch it to find that I missed a single ) character, it worked perfectly after that. I will be finishing the tutorial tomorrow.

### Day 57: July 21, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a YouTube tutorial on creating a PHP/MySQL login and registration page for users, completed 4 exercises on Codecademy, and updated my developmentNotes wiki .

**Thoughts:** It was very satisfying completing the over an hour long YouTube tutorial and it actually working! I am now able to program a user sign up, and log in page! Although this was a big breakthrough, I felt it necessary to switch back to Free Code Camp. I am almost done all of the modules for the Front End Development Certificate. I finished up the remaining intermediate algorithm scripting exercises with great difficulty. I was able to get the pseudo code, but the syntax and specific functions required for the specific outcomes are things I still need help with. I'm hoping the advanced projects will help me learn and apply these scripts.

### Day 58: July 22, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Calculator project.

**Thoughts:** I was quite nervous to begin this advanced front end development project because it's building a tool that does math, a scary subject. However, I decided to break down this project into steps. Starting with the layout and styling, making sure the look and feel is exactly how I want it to be, before even thinking about the complex backend that must be required to complete it. Styling it took a little longer than expected, it's those long buttons that shift everything out of place. Fortunately, I was able to code what I wanted today. Tomorrow, I will get started on the JavaScript end of things.

### Day 59: July 23, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Calculator project.

**Thoughts:** This is turning out to be more complex than I realized. I finished up all the styling, and then added the functionalities to the buttons. I think I figured that part out, I have all the number and operation buttons doing their things. What I forsee myself being stuck on is what to do with the array of numbers once you hit that equals button. So far I have all the operations pushed into a single array and I just need to figure out how to compute the operation. I would be simple if it was limited to a single operation, but the challenge requires the ability to chain operations (such as 3x3+5/5). This will make things complicated, I really hope I can figure this one out on my own.

### Day 60: July 24, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Calculator project.

**Thoughts:** Today was just one of those great days of coding. I was approaching the finish line, all I needed to do was figure out how to compute the string of operations I was getting when you pressed the buttons on the calculator (ex. 3*4-5/2). I was drafting all sorts of crazy functions and scripts trying to parse through the damn string to then be able to calculate it. Such as looping through the array, saving the numbers to one variable, then switching upon hitting an operation, trying out switch cases, the works. Then I came across the simple eval() function. This actually just takes my perfectly formed string, and computes it. Problem solved! I was so thrilled that I even through in a little easter egg into my calculator. Meaning there appears a hidden message when a user types in a certain combination of numbers. Can you find it? It actually shouldn't be that difficult since you want view the source code, but where's the fun in that.

### Day 61: July 25, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp's Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts:** This exercise, like all the previous ones, seem so simple to code. It is only when you are waist-deep when you realize that the functionalities you need to add are more complex than anticipated. I do find these projects are perfectly structured for preparing us coding newbies for the real world. Introducing projects with more scripting involved, trains us to ensure that we are coding something that won't easily break. Sure, styling a website is easy because it can just look a certain way and you're done, but developing a calculator or clock, you need to make sure it actually works! Today, I focused on styling a look and feel for my clock, then worry about the advanced scripting tomorrow. It was pretty tough landing on a certain look, but I made sure I didn't settle, and kept at it until it looked exactly how I wanted it.

### Day 62: July 26, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts:** I was very surprised that I was actually able to fully complete this project! I vividly remember struggling with timers and countdowns, so much resetting and other structures are needed so nothing breaks. To my surprise, I was able to complete 99% of the scripting by working out some form of pseudo code, and then searching online for helping tutorials and examples. The last 1% that was missing was getting the reset button to fully stop the timer. I then went onto the Free Code Camp Gitter chat and asked if someone could help me. Not to my surprise, someone jumped in, went over my code, and notified me that I was missing a single, but crucial line of code. He was so kind and helpful, really appreciate how nice the online coding community can be. I was also very glad that the line of code I was missing was a simple mistake, that was easily corrected. I fully expected him to say that my code was terrible and I'm not doing something right here. It's very encouraging that coding is simply solving a problem, it's more creative and simply typing in a language, there are many ways to do one thing.

### Day 63: July 27, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the FreeCodeCamp's Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** Now this project will be incorporating a new skillset that I have never done before, scripting in some form of AI. Creating a simple Tic Tac Toe game seems easy enough, but once player options are set in and you can play against the computer, things start to get interesting. Now, I've done some form of AI in Processing, but that method used brute force, rather than algorithm scripting. I wonder how I should approach this form of AI for the game. Today, I focused on styling the project, and creating the layouts needed for each game state. I will probably begin the AI as just placing random moves around the available spots on the board, then migrate to a smarter form of AI where the player will never win. That will make it more fun, right?

### Day 64: July 28, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Tic Tac Toe project, and started working on the FreeCodeCamp's final Front End Development Project, building a Simon Says project.

**Thoughts:** I thouroughly enjoyed working on this project! It was similar to previous ones, where I began with the layout and styling, and then moved into the complex backend of things. I deliberately coded an "AI" that wasn't impossible to beat, I mean, where's the fun in that. It was a different experience coding some form of "AI" for a project, where if it didn't work the way I wanted (ex, there was something wrong in the code), I would blame the AI as if it was an actual living entity. I completed the project a lot faster than I had anticipated, that is why I started on the Simon says project. I am excited to start working on this one! It is also very encouraging when I tweet out a completed project, and the feedback is always so positive and uplifting from the online community!

### Day 65: July 29, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Simon Says project.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have too much time for coding today, so I squeezed in as much as I could in the morning. I continued styling the Simon Says board to look as much like the original as possible, using HTML and CSS, and not any background images or other gimmicks. I must say that by the end of my coding session, I had structured and stylized the game pretty well using only HTML and CSS. I figured that since this is my final project, there is no way that I am cutting any corners or giving up early to complete this any faster. I have great instructions and users stories that need to be completed, and am looking forward to diving into the complex scripting that will be needed for this project.

### Day 66: July 30, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Simon Says project.

**Thoughts:** Today I focused on styling the project to look exactly how I imagined it. Figuring out some button issues took longer than expected, but I do believe that the overall structure and layout are not ready for some scripting. I started doodling the psuedo code in my notebook, because I want to make sure that I have a gameplan on how to tackle this challenge. A few of my previous projects, I just dove in head first and adapted to any new changes that I didn't forsee. This usually ends up in the code being very messing, but it still gets the job done. I want this project to be code that I am proud of!

### Day 67: July 31, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Simon Says project.

**Thoughts:** I began to add some functionalities to the structured project. For some reason, I began the layout of the game with divs that had no functionality. I changed them to buttons and created that pressing animation that lights up each button. The actual playing of the game will be something else of a challenge to overcome. It took me longer than expected to figure out how to add an animation to the winning display screen, then remove the animation class, in case a user actually wins twice in one sitting. It was tempting to just leave that part out, but I stayed the course and eventually figured things out.

### Day 68: August 01, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FreeCodeCamp's Simon Says project.

**Thoughts:** Today I started to add the functionalities to the project, a task that seems to be a bit more complex than anticipated. Overall, I do believe I have most of the project complete. One can play the game in its entirety, use the strict mode, and even reset for a new game. The only trouble I am having is getting the colours to properly display with delays for each sequence. They all seem to light up at the same time, and it's only their shut off that is properly delayed. Once that I figure that one out, I just need to clean up a few things, add sound effects, then I am done!

### Day 69: August 02, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp's Simon Says project, and received my Front End Development Certification from Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** What a wonderful day for my journey of learning to code! I finally completed my Simon Says project, there were several bumps in the road, but I am proud to have overcome them all by myself. It was very exciting to slowly add the functionilities one by one and it actually working along the way. Once it was completed and I submitted it for review, I was prompted to claim my Front End Development Certification. I am very excited to receive this award, and I can't believe I am actually "good" enough to have this sort of certification. I really never pictured myself being able to code that well to earn some sort of milestone. I cannot wait to get started on backend projects!

### Day 70: August 03, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** It's nice going back to learning something new from Free Code Camp, although these exercises on npm are being completed on Cloud 9. Most of the exercises are straightforward with direct instructions on how to complete each exercise. I do have some trouble when the exercise says to do something that seems so simple, but since Free Code Camp has not touched the command line yet, I don't know the commands. It's not that big of a deal since I just learn as I go, it actually enables me to research online and learn on my own. I'm very excited to see where this Back End Development module leads me.

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Continued working on the NPM module. It's pretty interesting learning this way through the command line on a remote instance that can run Node.js packages. It is taking me a bit longer to complete these exercises because I am writing down extensive notes and constantly looking up new terms as they come up. I wonder what it will be like to create working projects using these npm packages.

### Day 72: August 05, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** More exercises for the npm tutorial. I'm beginning to be a little skeptical as to what I can actually create with these npm packages. Are these backend databases, or is it like running a remote server to host website pages? I am assuming that all of this will be detailed in the next Free Code Camp module. At least when I started the Front End part, I had some background experience with HTML and CSS, where now, I have almost zero knowledge of backend requirements. However, I am really excited to learn all about back nd things to create projects that can store data with tables and such. I've always been fascinated by data, and I'm sure this module comes in handy later on!

**Thoughts:** These final exercises took much longer than anticipated. Although most of them required typing in specific commands into the remote terminal, there was one exercise that had little to no documentation, but expected you to know some specific syntax to complete it. It was for the dist-tag removal, I tried so many combinations of code, but nothing was working out. I was only after spending a long time searching through forums and YouTube videos where I found the correct way to complete the exercise. Although it was a new experience, I don't feel that I learned too much about what exactly NPMs are used for. I guess that will be demonstrated in a later module. That is where my developmentNotes wiki comes in handy, for quick reference, rather than searching through the entire module again.

### Day 74: August 07, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** The new module I am working on is the Start a Node.js Server. The exercises were pretty straight forward, creating simple Javascript programs that utilize the functionalities of the Node.js server. However, I feel that the difficulty curve is way too steep for a beginner tutorial module. I searched online for help, and it seems that this module on Free Code Camp may be "broken" in that is it too difficult for early Back End campers, such as myself. Fortunately, I was able to find several resources that broke down each exercise to assist with the proper syntax. I always try to complete an exercise myself, but am always one step short to complete it. That is where online help comes in hand.

### Day 75: August 08, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the learnyounode module on FreeCodeCamp, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I am very glad to be done this module. I am repeating myself when I say that the learning curve for this module was extremely steep, especially for beginner and aspiring backend developers. The first exercise was print out the words HELLO WORLD, and the 5th one was HTTP Client protocols, asynchronous functions, all without proper documentation. This did not spark any enthusiasm for Node.js, nor do I believe I learned that much, since most of my time was spent searching for why a certain exercise wasn't working properly. Apparently I wasn't alone on this, and this gives me hope. I will most likely search for another tutorial on Node.js, seeing that this one may have passed me by without sticking.

### Day 76: August 09, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the w3schools Node.js Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Just as I suspected, I attemped the next challenge on Free Code Camp, Express.js, but even the Hello World example was out of my league. The previous module didn't really teach at a beginner level, so I don't think I absorbed the proper information to move on. That being said, I decided to search for a simple tutorial on Node.js to 're-learn' this tool. I decided to go with the w3schools Node.js tutorial for beginners. After completing several steps, so far so good. I am taking diligent notes, and not moving forward until I understand the concepts. I already feel like I have learned more from w3schools because it gave context to what Node.js is and how it operates. The previous module did no such thing, it just dove right into the code (same with how-to-npm, it never actually detailed what npm stood for!). I am confident that this module will help me get back on track, there seems to be a lot of potential for using Node.js.

### Day 77: August 10, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the w3schools Node.js Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial of Node.js was a great introduction to this tool! It was simple, yet provided many useful examples such as the HTTP server, or even sending emails via Node.js. I was left somewhat hanging (yet again, when completing an online coding tutorial online), where I now know the basics of the language/tool, but no idea how to implement it and make it work. I know to initiate a file you need the command line, but how would one even create the file on a server, and have it launched when an event was fired? I guess this tutorial was just the basic features and syntax to get a foundation. I would need to do further research and tutorials until I am ready to see it in action on my own. I am thinking that I will do the w3schools PHP tutorial next, just to give myself better context for this tool. I forsee myself using PHP udirng the next few months, so I may just take a break from the Free Code Camp Back End Development Certification (mostly, because I just cannot keep up with the difficulty curve), and hone my PHP skills.

### Day 78: August 11, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Stared the w3schools PHP 5 Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to pursue PHP as my first server side language to learn and use for projects. I was contemplating trying out Node.js in order to complete the Free Code Camp Back End Development Certification. However, I do believe that I will be using PHP more often in the next several months, with school and other personal projects. I need to buckle down and stop jumping from language to language, that is why I starting from the beginning once again, this time doing the w3schools tutorial for PHP. So far, I thoroughly enjoy the background and context w3schools provides at the start of their tutorials, it's a great setup to see how PHP is used, and what it can be used to do. I'm excited to learn more about this tool, and cannot wait to see it in action!

### Day 79: August 12, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the w3schools PHP 5 Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I completed a few more examples on the w3schools PHP 5 tutorial today. Most of it was just basic review of syntax, and because of the language being server side, it took a little longer to set it up to be able to follow along. Thankfully, I am using MAMP, rather than a hosting service with PHP support. It's always good for some review every now and then.

### Day 80: August 13, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the w3schools PHP 5 Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Today was more review on PHP syntax and features. Although these exercises are review of things I should already know, because I am using a different (and perhaps more thorough) source, I am learning many new things about PHP that I hadn't before, such as the static or global variable keywords, or even you can echo a variable inside string quotations!

### Day 81: August 14, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the w3schools PHP 5 Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I finally completed the w3schools PHP 5 tutorial! It was a great resource to go through for sure! Most of it was basic review of syntax for coding that overlaps with over languages, such as functions and operators between PHP and JavaScript. Although the end of the tutorial detailed the superglobals that I am sure to need for some projects I would like to complete sooner than later. I will start the PHP 5 Forms tutorial from w3schools tomorrow, it seems to cover a more advanced topic, the previous tutorial was a great setup for contuining my path to learn PHP.

### Day 82: August 15, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the w3schools PHP 5 Forms Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial module was rather short, but extremely important for PHP in terms of things I should know; form handling. I honestly expected a simple breakdown of how to setup the form with PHP, then how to use the data elsewhere. However, this tutorial went into proper security measurements to take when handling forms that may have sensitive information. It was very interesting to learn about how to avoid certain vulnerabilities in forms with simple scripts or other built-in functions. Now I have a basic understanding of gathering information from a form, and using it elsewhere on a webpage.

### Day 83: August 16, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the w3schools PHP 5 Advanced Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** I began the advanced tutorial for PHP today. Ultimately, I am aiming to work on the MSQL PHP tutorial, however the linearaity of the w3schools PHP tutorial shows this advanced module before the MySQL. Since I'm all about learning as much as I can, I will go through this module in its entirety. So far I have learned some essential things such as include files, and multidimensional arrays.

### Day 84: August 17, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the w3schools PHP 5 Advanced Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial module is really shaping into some neat ways you can leverage the PHP language. I went over how to read and write files on the server, upload files, and generate cookies. I'm taking diligent notes and constantly thinking about how I can use each of these tools effectively come time to try it out on my own. I was a little confused about the cookies section. It detailed how to make one and load it, but not how to use it later for its features. I can just do some further research on that, but only once I am more comfortable with the basics.

### Day 85: August 18, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the w3schools PHP 5 Advanced Tutorial, completed the w3schools PHP MySQL Database Tutorial, and updated my developmentNotes wiki.

**Thoughts:** Completing the rest of the advanced examples of PHP was very helpful, they went over filters and error handling, something I expect to need when beginning with this language. I also started and completed the entire PHP MySQL Database Tutorial on w3schools. This section was an important section to go over since I will be needing to use MySQL for Curated Canvas some day. This chapter didn't have too much context or other information, it was purely examples of how to do certain functionalities. Nonetheless, I took diligent notes and look forward to start testing my new PHP skills.

### Day 86: August 19, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** Seeing that I've recently completed several thorough tutorials on PHP and MySQL database, I decided to try and implement some PHP functionality into my localhost version of Curated Canvas beta (hosted through MAMP). Adding the PHP was pretty straight forward, but I am slowly adding each feature one at a time. I don't want to go too fast and lose my place or break my code beyond my skillset to repair. Plus, when I add something, such as connecting my page to the MySQL database, I make sure to understand every line of code I add. There were times in some tutorials where I was lost but kept going, and eventually caught up to what the module was explaining. I am being very diligent to understand all the code inside Curated Canvas. I even made a new branch on my git repo for this project (first time outside of a tutorial!), so I'm also learning new this for git as well.

### Day 87: August 20, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** Today was a bit discouraging in terms of coding PHP into my already existing HTML pages. I went over the form tutorial and MySQL many times, trying to add in the functionality of inserting form data into MySQL. I was also having difficulty managing my CSS stylesheet with my code. It just wouldn't update for some reason! I suspected that I was editing the file from the master branch (which is no longer the most current version of my code), but it turns out it was simple the cache needed clearing. I will try again tomorrow, and am hoping to get better results. I knew this part would be difficult, I just need to keep trying and stay positive.

### Day 88: August 21, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** Today was a much better day than yesterday in terms of implementing code that actually works! I actually revisited an old YouTube tutorial I completed and used that code as inspiration. I was able to figure out user sign ups quite fast to my surprise. The next hurdle was getting them to sign in with that information. For some reason, it took a while to get this to work (you would think that sign ups are more advanced than log ins). I realized it was just some syntax errors here and there. What is making this more difficult (than it should be, I believe) is my lack of knowledge to print out the error logs to pin point the problems. I should figure that portion out next if I am to add more advanced functionality to Curated Canvas.

### Day 89: August 22, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** Another great day for coding! I was able to accomplish a good deal of what I wanted to. I added many more form validation requirements for the user sign up and log in features. I was worried that changing it from the YouTube tutorial code would be out of my skillset, but I broke it down and was able to do it! The important step was ensuring that I fully understood the code before taking it apart and re-assembling it. Although some of the functions used, I've never heard of them before, I now understand what they do. That's the tricky part of beginning to code, to figure out if there is an already existing built-in function that can perform the task you're looking for, or do you have to code it from scratch? Luckily, online resources are simple to navigate and are always very helpful. I'm also enjoying pushing the new code to my GitHub repo, feels to professional when I do that.

### Day 90: August 23, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt like learning something new with PHP, but still work on Curated Canvas. That being said, I decided to learn how to sent emails using PHP. Something pretty standard when signing up for an online site is a welcome email is sent to you (or a confirmation email, perhaps I'll learn that next). I was having some difficulties getting the built-in php mail() function to work. Turns out there are issues when using localhost and MAMP. I then found a plugin called PHPMailer which worked perfectly! It uses gmail to send out emails (which is our email service for Curated Canvas, so that works!). This then lead to my researching how to properly secure hard coded passwords in source code. I need to input my gmail password for the PHPMailer authentication, so learning how the pros properly secure passwords in source code is something I need to learn (especially for when I use a real MySQL database).

### Day 91: August 24, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta.

**Thoughts:** I mostly cleaned up my code today, a much needed exercise. There were many redundant classes/id's the works. I also wanted to start connecting my code to the Artsy API. I knew that I needed some JavaScript/jQuery to manipulate the page and get the API information, however I was having difficulty loading the JavaScript. I suspected that it was because I split my header and footer from my body page using PHP. I had to turn to stackoverflow to ask why it wasn't working, and it the reason was the script.js file was being loaded before the page. I just needed to load the file in my footer, rather than my header. Glad it was a simple fix. Tomorrow I will try to connect to the API myself!

### Day 92: August 25, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta, and connected to the Artsy API.

**Thoughts:** Today was quite the struggle, I must say. Connecting to the API was way more complex than I had anticipated. I was going off of my experience connecting to the Wikipedia or Twitch API (where you weren't required a token or other form of authentication). The Artsy API was turning out to be more difficult since I needed to use cURL on the PHP side of things, where I thought I could use JavaScript. Anyway, after much research online, and having to ask several questions on Stack Overflow, I finally got it to work and connect to the API and make a simple request! I basically took all day, but I am proud to have figured it out with the help of the online community. Now my next struggle would be to determine how to save the data for each user to the database. Does each user get their own table? Or just a row? Just some things I need to figure out before jumping in.

### Day 93: August 26, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding PHP functionality to Curated Canvas beta, and connected to the Artsy API.

**Thoughts:** Although I may not have coded too much today, it was mostly figuring out how to manipulating my API requests to get the speicific data that I need, such as artist, artwork, year, medium, and of course, the image of piece. I was very proud to have figured out how to parse through the array of artworks that is generated through the API request. My mind is now thinking of how to organize the data so that it is randomly generated for the users. I'm not sure of a way to generate a random key that would match the API, so I was thinking of perhaps data-dumping the API info into a database of my own, that way I can control which artwork is displayed for each user. There are other bonuses that come with this, such as not relying on the slowness of the API requests, where a request to an internal database should be instant! Easier said than done, of course.
